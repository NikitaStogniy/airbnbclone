## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains a TypeScript file called HeartButton.tsx, which implements a React component called HeartButton. The purpose of the HeartButton component is to display a heart icon that can be toggled on and off. It takes in a listingId and currentUser as props, and uses a custom hook called useFavorite to handle the logic for checking if the listing is favorited and toggling the favorite status. When the button is clicked, it calls the toggleFavorite function from the useFavorite hook. The button has hover and transition effects, and renders two heart icons, one filled and one outlined, based on the hasFavorite state from the useFavorite hook.
